## Overview

Neural networks are at the heart of modern artificial intelligence. This article provides a comprehensive introduction to understanding how they work.

## What are Neural Networks?

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

## Key Concepts

### Perceptrons

The basic building block of neural networks is the perceptron, which takes inputs, applies weights, and produces an output.

### Layers

- **Input Layer:** Receives the input data
- **Hidden Layers:** Process the data through weighted connections
- **Output Layer:** Produces the final prediction

### Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns.

## Common Architectures

- **Feedforward Networks:** Basic neural networks with data flowing in one direction
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Specialized for image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Designed for sequential data

## Conclusion

Neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex problems. Understanding their fundamentals is the first step toward mastering deep learning.
