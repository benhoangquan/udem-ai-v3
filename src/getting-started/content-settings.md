# Changing Content Settings for 0.9

Content in your app may be filtered based on your content settings. Because of this adjusting your content settings might be necessary. Here is how to do it:

1. Go to your iOS System settings.
2. Scroll to Apps.
3. Select Paperback.
4. Enable the `Enable content settings`.
5. In Paperback, go to your settings then `General Settings`.
6. Customize the content setting to your preference. Available options are "Restricted", "Mature" and "Adult".

::: tip Notes

- If you set your content settings to "Adult" on the portal, you can control what content appears in the app by navigating to **Settings** > **General** > **Content Filtering**.
- Setting your content settings to anything lower than "Adult" will prevent you from installing extensions from repositories containing at least one "Adult" extension. The same applies to "Mature".
